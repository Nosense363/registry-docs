= Deploy Your Own Devfile Registry

The following document outlines the steps to deploy your own devfile registry on Kubernetes.

It's recommended that you read xref:setting-up-registry.adoc first, to understand how to build your own devfile registry image.

**Note:** At this time, due to https://github.com/devfile/api/issues/388, if you do **not** have publicly signed certificates for your cluster, you must disable TLS for the devfile registry to use the devfile registry with odo.

== Devfile Registry Operator

If you have https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager[Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)] installed on your cluster, the recommended way to install a devfile registry is to use the https://github.com/devfile/registry-operator[devfile-registry operator].

For information on installing OLM on your Kubernetes cluster, please consult the https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/getting-started/[OLM QuickStart Guide]

=== Installing the Devfile Registry Operator

1. Download and install the operator-sdk CLI from https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/operator-sdk/latest/

2. Run the `operator-sdk run bundle quay.io/devfile/registry-operator-bundle:next` command.

  - At the present moment, since the Devfile Registry operator is not onboarded to OperatorHub, the operator-sdk CLI must be used to install the operator

3. Once the operator is installed, you can than proceed to create `DevfileRegistry` resources on your cluster

=== Deploying Devfile Registries

Once the Devfile Registry Operator is installed, you can easily deploy devfile registries by doing the following:

==== OpenShift

Installing the devfile registry via the devfile registry operator on an OpenShift cluster can be done in one easy command:

```
$ cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: registry.devfile.io/v1alpha1
kind: DevfileRegistry
metadata:
  name: devfile-registry
spec:
  devfileIndexImage: quay.io/devfile/devfile-index:next
EOF
```

If you are deploying your own devfile registry, change the `devfileIndexImage` field to the container image that was built in xref:setting-up-registry.adoc[]

==== Kubernetes

Installing the devfile registry on a Kubernetes cluster is similar, but requires setting the k8s.ingressDomain field first.

```
$ export INGRESS_DOMAIN=<my-ingress-domain>
```

Followed by:

```
$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: registry.devfile.io/v1alpha1
kind: DevfileRegistry
metadata:
  name: devfile-registry
spec:
  devfileIndexImage: quay.io/devfile/devfile-index:next
  tls:
    enabled: false
  k8s:
    ingressDomain: $INGRESS_DOMAIN
EOF
```

If you are deploying your own devfile registry, change the `devfileIndexImage` field to the container image that was built in xref:setting-up-registry.adoc[]

== Devfile Registry Helm Chart

If https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager[Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)] is not installed on your Kubernetes cluster, the Devfile Registry Helm Chart is an alternative to using the Devfile Registry operator.

To install the devfile registry Helm chart:

1. Run the `git clone https://github.com/devfile/registry-support` to clone the repository containing the Helm chart

2. Navigate to the `deploy/chart/devfile-registry` folder.

3. Open the `values.yaml` file in an editor and make the following changes

  - Set `devfileIndex.image` to the image containing your devfile stacks.
  - Set `devfileIndex.tag` to the image tag for your devfile index image.
  - If installing on Kubernetes, set `global.ingress.domain` to your cluster's ingress domain.
  - If installing on OpenShift, set `global.isOpenShift` to true.

4. Run the `helm install devfile-registry ./` command to install the Helm chart.

For more information on the Devfile Registry Helm chart, consult https://github.com/devfile/registry-support/blob/master/deploy/chart/devfile-registry/README.md[its readme].
