== Devfile Registry Structure
This document outlines the structure of a Devfile Registry Repository thatâ€™s used as the basis for an OCI Devfile Registry, hosted on Kubernetes. It also outlines how individual files in each stack will get pushed up to the OCI registry.

=== Repository Structure
The following requirements are imposed on the devfile registry repository:

1) A top-level folder called `stacks`, which contains folders for each devfile stack.

2) Each devfile stack folder must contain a `devfile.yaml`. Other files such as vsx plugins, stack logos, etc. can be included as needed. 

3) Any build tools for the registry (such as scripts or Dockerfiles) should not be located at the top-level of the stack, and should reside in their own folder.

4) An optional file called `extraDevfileEntries.yaml` can be added under the root of the devfile registry source repository to add samples and stacks from other repositories to the registry. This file contains the location information on where the extra samples and stacks can be found. For example:

Sample `extraDevfileEntries.yaml`:
```
schemaVersion: 1.0.0
samples:
  - name: nodejs-basic
    displayName: Basic NodeJS
    description: A simple Hello World application
    icon: nodejsIcon.svg
    tags: ["NodeJS", "Express"]
    projectType: nodejs
    language: nodejs
    git:
      remotes:
        origin: https://github.com/redhat-developer/devfile-sample
  - name: vertx-secured-http
    displayName: Vert.x with secured HTTP
    description: A Vert.x application using secured HTTP
    icon: vertxIcon.svg
    tags: ["Java", "Vert.x"]
    projectType: vertx
    language: java
    git:
      remotes:
        origin: https://github.com/openshift-vertx-examples/vertx-secured-http-example-redhat
```

The https://github.com/devfile/registry[devfile/registry] repository is a good example of a Devfile Registry source repository that adheres to these requirements.

=== Layer Media types
When devfile stacks are stored in an OCI reigstry, it's stored as https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/layer.md[multiple layers], with the following media types defined for each layer:

**Devfile**

`devfile.yaml` -> `application/vnd.devfileio.devfile.layer.v2+yaml`

**VSX Plugins**

`*.vsx` -> `application/vnd.devfileio.vsx.layer.v1.tar`

**Stack logos**

`logo.svg` -> `image/svg+xml` or

`logo.png` -> `image/png`

**Everything else**

`archive.tar` - `application/x-tar`

As part of the registry build process that packages the stacks into a container image, any files not belonging to the devfile, vsx or logo media types will be lumped together in a tar archive (using the media type `application/x-tar`).

When a devfile registry container image is deployed (or updated), the devfile stacks are pushed to the OCI registry as part of a multi-layer artifact. Each file belonging to one of the above media types (`devfile.yaml`, `*.vsx`, `logo.svg`/`logo.png`, `archive.tar`) will be treated as separate layers in the artifact.
